<article><h2>Card Sorting Test</h2>
    <p class=card>One individual participated in the card sorting test, 21 years old international student. The purpose of the test was to find out what the user considers as being the most relevant information. The participant completed the task after dedicating it some time. According to the result, as it can also be observed in the images below. However, we disagree on having social media in the header due to the fact that most websites are accessed from social media. We agree on having upcoming events on homepage.

<article><h2>Personas</h2>
<p class=card><strong>Anna is a 26 years old</strong> international architecture student, currently living in Copenhagen. She loves arts and architecture, attending social events and hanging out with her friends in coffee shops. She often characterizes herself as social, outgoing and open minded.

As a person that often goes to events, she would like to be in a loyalty program where she can get discounts and email with recommended events for her; she is mindful about the budget. When it comes to choosing the right event for her and her friends she would like to have clearly defined the categories on a website. Anna would like to invite her friends to the event through facebook.

She gets frustrated when the website is confusing, purchasing tickets takes too long and event sorting is poor. </p></article>

    <article><p class=card><strong>Maria-Pilar is a 24 years old</strong> tourist from Barcelona, Spain, that visited Copenhagen with her boyfriend for a weekend. She is a interior designer and has a strong passion for reading, loves boardgames, teather and cozy nights with her friends.

She doesn’t know what’s interesting in Copenhagen, so she searches “Copenhagen events” on google and one of the first results is Huset Kbh, which gets her attention, and she would really love to find out more about those events.

Curiosity turns into frustration when she figures out that the website takes a while to load, the event sorting it’s confusing and time-consuming, and she can’t tell really easy where the events are, as the location is also confusing.

    <article><p class=card><strong>John is 25 years old male, from England</strong> and is currently visiting his friends in Copenhagen. John is social and outgoing, he enjoys live jazz music and good food.
<br><br>
Since John has not been in Copenhagen before, his needs are to quickly access a map in order to see how long it will take him to get to the event place. He finds out about a live jazz music concert on facebook that he would like to attend.
        <br><br>
        John ends up on the Huset Kbh's website and he starts searching for events, he finds out that the website is confusing and some of the events lead him to other websites. This experience makes him think that the website is untrustworthy, therefore he choses to leave the website and consult some other sources.
