<article><h2>Card Sorting Test</h2>
    <p class=card>One individual participated in card sorting test, 21 years old international student. Purpose of the test was to show us what’s the most important information to user. Participant completed task, even though he struggled a little bit. However, we disagree on having social media in header due to fact that most of users come to websites from social media. We agree on having upcoming events on homepage.

    <article><p class=card><strong>Maria-Pilar is a 24 years old</strong> tourist from Barcelona, Spain, that visited Copenhagen with her boyfriend for a weekend. She is a interior designer and has a strong passion for reading, loves boardgames, teather and cozy nights with her friends.

She doesn’t know what’s interesting in Copenhagen, so she searches “Copenhagen events” on google and one of the first results is Huset Kbh, which gets her attention, and she would really love to find out more about those events.

Curiosity turns into frustration when she figures out that the website takes a while to load, the event sorting it’s confusing and time-consuming, and she can’t tell really easy where the events are, as the location is also confusing.
